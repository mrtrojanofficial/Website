	<h1>
		What is Cyber Security ?
	</h1>
	
	<h3>
		Define
	</h3>
	<p>
		Cyber security is a term that you may have heard before, but you may not be exactly
sure what it means or why it is important. Simply put, cyber security refers to the
measures taken to protect computer systems and networks from cyber attacks,
theft, damage, or unauthorised access
	</p>


<img src="thumbnail1.jpg">

	<h3>
		Explain
	</h3>

<p>
	In today's digital age, where most of our daily activities are done online, cyber
security has become a crucial aspect of our lives. With the rise of digital technology
and the internet, we have become increasingly dependent on computers and mobile
devices for communication, work, entertainment, and financial transactions.
However, this increased reliance on technology has also made us vulnerable to
various cyber threats that can compromise our personal and sensitive information.
</p>



<h3>
	Cyber Attacks
</h3>


<p>
	Cyber attacks can take many forms and come from different sources, including
hackers, cybercriminals, state-sponsored groups, and even insiders. Some common
types of cyber attacks include phishing, malware, ransomware, denial-of-service
attacks, and social engineering. These attacks can cause serious harm to
individuals, businesses, and organisations, including financial loss, identity theft,
reputational damage, and legal consequences.
</p>

<h3>
	Protection
</h3>

<p>
	To protect against these threats, cyber security professionals employ various
strategies and technologies to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
computer systems and networks. Here are some of the key components of cyber
security that you should be aware of:
</p>


<div class="dot">
<p>
	● Confidentiality: Confidentiality refers to the protection of sensitive and
confidential information from unauthorised access or disclosure. This can be
achieved through encryption, access control, and data masking techniques.
For example, when you enter your password to log in to your online banking
account, the system uses encryption to keep your password and account
information secure from potential eavesdropping or interception.
</p>


<p>
	● Integrity: Integrity refers to the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data
and information. Cyber security measures are put in place to ensure that data
is not altered, deleted, or tampered with by unauthorised individuals or
malware. This can be achieved through techniques such as digital signatures,
checksums, and integrity checks.
</p>

<p>
	● Availability: Availability refers to the ability of computer systems and networks
to be accessible and operational at all times. Cyber security measures aim toprevent or mitigate disruptions to computer systems and networks caused by
cyber attacks or other incidents. This can be achieved through measures such
as backup and recovery procedures, redundancy, and disaster recovery plans.
</p>


<p>
	● Education and awareness: Education and awareness refer to the importance
of educating and training individuals on cyber security best practices and
raising awareness of cyber threats. This includes teaching individuals how to
identify and avoid phishing emails, how to create strong passwords, and how
to secure their personal devices and networks.

<div class="last">
	<p>
		Now that you have a better understanding of what cyber security is and its
importance, it's important to take steps to protect yourself and your personal
information online. Here are some simple tips to improve your cyber security:
	</p>
</div>

<div class="tip">
	<h3>
		Pro Tip
	</h3>
</div>

<p>
	1. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords
for each of your accounts.
</p>
<p>
	2. Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible to add an extra
layer of security to your accounts.
