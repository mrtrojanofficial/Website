		What is Trojan ?
	</h1>
	
	<h3>
		Introduction:
	</h3>
	<p>
		In the world of cybersecurity, there are several types of malware that can harm your
computer or device. One of the most common types of malware is called a Trojan or
Trojan horse. In this blog, we'll define what a Trojan is, how it works, and how you
can protect yourself from this threat.

	<h3>
		Definition:
	</h3>

<p>
	A Trojan is a type of malware that is disguised as a legitimate file or program. It is
named after the Trojan horse of Greek mythology because, like the wooden horse, it
appears harmless on the outside but contains a harmful payload inside. Trojans can
be designed to look like software updates, games, or other files that users are likely
to download or open.
</p>



<h3>
	Explanation:
</h3>


<p>
	When a user downloads or opens a Trojan, it can perform various harmful actions on
their computer or device. Some Trojans are designed to steal sensitive information,
such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. Others may create
backdoors that allow hackers to access the infected system remotely. Trojans can
also delete files, modify system settings, or download additional malware onto the
infected device.

<p>
	To protect against these threats, cyber security professionals employ various
strategies and technologies to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
computer systems and networks. Here are some of the key components of cyber
security that you should be aware of:

<h3>
	How to Be Secure from Trojans:
</h3>
<p>
	Protecting your computer or device from Trojans requires a combination of proactive
measures and common sense. Here are some tips to help you stay safe:
</p>


<div class="dot">
	<p>
		1. Use antivirus software: A good antivirus program can detect and remove
Trojans before they can do any damage. Make sure to keep your antivirus
software up to date to ensure the best protection.
	</p>

<p>
	2. Be cautious of downloads: Only download files and programs from trusted
sources. Avoid downloading anything from unverified websites or suspicious
emails.
</p>


<p>
	3. Keep your software up to date: Software updates often contain security
patches that can fix vulnerabilities that Trojans can exploit. Make sure to
install updates for your operating system and applications regularly.
</p>

<p>
	4. Use strong passwords: Trojans can steal passwords to gain access to
sensitive information. Use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and
consider using a password manager to keep them organized
</p>

<p>
	5. Don't click on suspicious links: Avoid clicking on links in emails or websites
that seem too good to be true or ask for personal information. These may be
phishing scams that can lead to a Trojan infection.
