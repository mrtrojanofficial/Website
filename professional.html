Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).<br>2. Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA).<br>3. Certified Information Security Manager (CISM).<br>4. CompTIA Security+. (security+).<br>5. Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH).<br>6. GIAC Security Essentials Certification (GSEC).<br>7. Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP).<br>8. CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+).<br>9. GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH).<br>10. Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP).<br></p></div><h1>Formal education</h1><div class="para6"><p>Before you get into cyber security professionally you need to complete your formal education.<br></p></div><div class="para7"><p>Now the formal education means the education which you get from your school, College and University.<br></p></div><div class="para8"><p>Now you need to complete your formal education in these grades.</p></div><div class="para9"><p>• School<br>• Collage<br>• University<br></p></div><h1>School</h1><div class="para10"><p>In School education system you need to complete these things.</p></div><div class="para11"><p>First after passing 5th grade some of schools starts teaching computer from 6 th grade some from 8th grade but its optional and it's not that much important but if you did it you will have more experience or basic knowledge then others. But the important thing is to choose computer science in 9 th grade and in 10th grade it can help you to know the basics of computer and also schools will teach you basic of some programming languages like HTML and C/C++.</p></div><div class="para12"><p>The main thing is if you select your computer science subject from 9 th grade then you can better perform your technical skills in cyber security. And for that you need to be get a 10 th grade degree in computer science.</p></div><h1>Collage</h1><div class="para13"><p>Now in some of the countries they have different curriculum of education like they are providing 12 th degree in schools but in my country Pakistan the schooling system is completed after 10 th grade the student goes to colleges for their 12th grade degree.</p></div><div class="para14"><p>So basically, to having a best background in IT you will need to choose your degree in computer science and complete the college session in computer science because your educational background really matters for your BS/BSC degree.</p></div><div class="para15"><p>After all these two years of college you can learn basic programming languages and it can make your base in programming and can help you in making discission and techniques in programming languages.</p></div><div class="para16"><p>So, for cyber security you need to be complete your 12th degree in computer science.</p></div><h1>University</h1><div class="para17"><p>In universities people will get stuck into choosing a university for their bachelors in cyber security.</p></div><div class="para18"><p>Now let me tell you one thing that if you really want to get into cyber security and you completed your 10th and 12th grade in computer science then don’t worry now it’s a time to get into your passion or get into cyber security actually, university can be matters at some points like their faculty their labs and their building but in cyber security you need to focus on following things.</p></div><div class="para19"><p>• Best or updated computer labs.<br>• Your subjects and the rules of university like (drugs and other unhealthy stuff).<br>• The staff/professors are really collaborative and helpful.<br>• Libraries like can they have a cyber security related books like (networking, Linux related stuff etc.).</p></div><h1>BSC Degree</h1><div class="para20"><p>Now after choosing university then you need to select your degree program in Bachelor of science in cyber security. After getting this, you need to get your focus on your degree and work hard and get good grades in every semester. In final semester you need to more collaborate with your professor because he will help you in getting good grades/GPA and for BSc in cyber security must need to get a 3.5 GPA.</p></div><div class="para21"><p>Important thing is that you must need to choose a degree with thesis because it can make your degree stronger and also it can be verified.</p></div><h1>Master's Degree</h1><div class="para22"><p>Now for (MA) master’s degree in cyber security you can continue in same university and for masters your need to focus on your academic staff more than your practical life because in master’s degree the one year is for academic staff and one for your research so be careful and focus on them.</p></div><h1>Pro Tip</h1><div class="para23"><p>The pro tip is that stay connected with me and read blogs on our site daily.</p></div></div></section><script>const aboutLink=document.querySelector('a[href="about.html"]');function redirectToAbout(e){e.preventDefault(),window.innerWidth>=700?window.location.href="about.html":window.location.href="mobile.html"}aboutLink.addEventListener("click",redirectToAbout);const navLinks=document.getElementById("navLinks"),menuIcon=document.querySelector(".fa-bars"),closeIcon=document.querySelector(".fa-times-circle");function showMenu(){navLinks.style.right="0"}function hideMenu(){navLinks.style.right="-200px"}menuIcon.addEventListener("click",showMenu),closeIcon.addEventListener("click",hideMenu);</script><script>window.oncontextmenu=function(){return alert(" ⚠️ Website is Protected "),!1}</script></body></html>
